    "dgc-faq-what-do-you-mean-decentralized-desc": "CheemsCoin is not run by any individual company or person. Technically speaking, it operates according to rules agreed by consensus, rather than decided upon by some founding or owning entity.",

    "dgc-faq-what-do-you-mean-cryptocurrency-desc": "A cryptocurrency is a digital currency that is secured by cryptography, in contrast to conventional (fiat) currencies where they are secured by a government or governments.",

    "dgc-faq-okay-but-what-does-that-mean-desc": "It means you don't have to trust any central organisation or person the way you would a bank, but also that you have to be your own bank. The developers can't seize your funds, but they also can't return them if you send them to the wrong address.",

The developers can release new software, but the community have to choose to use that software. That community includes not just the end-users, but miners, exchanges, payment processors, etc. Typically the community does adopt new software we release because we have an established track record, but there's no special access we have.",

As noted above, CheemsCoin is a decentralized project and the developers working on the project have no special access or ability to reverse transactions or recover funds.

    "dgc-faq-scam-giveaway-desc": "Sadly these are people impersonating the CheemsCoin founders, developers, or similar. No-one needs you to send them coins in order for them to send you coins back. There's a good article on this on the BBC news website at <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56402378\">https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56402378</a>.",
